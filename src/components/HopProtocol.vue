      <div style="word-break: break-word" class="spacing-playground mt-2 mx-6 pa-6 ">
        21st century technology opens up a new paradigm for health.  This can happen now as data and scientific understanding of nature has advanced and this evolves continuously through machine learning.  However, there is a choice to be made: Do we want to be the primary agent in our health or do we want to outsource our sovereignty to the cloud & corporations?  HOP and the no-code toolkit BentoBoxDS provides a way for those choosing agency and sovereign data to have primary health agency, self experimentation to building networks of collective intelligence peer to peer to improve our understanding and application of science to health.

      <div style="word-break: break-word" class="spacing-playground body-1 mt-2 mx-6 pa-6 ">
        A sovereign peer can learn much in isolation but can learn much more in a network.  The health of a bioregion to a model of the climate requires a new level of computational coherence and HOP (health oracle protocol) has be designed to make that possible.  Lastly, the monetary incentives of health reward treating disease and exploiting nature. HOP has no monetary incentive built-in, our focus is on empowering the coherence of computation with sovereign data that shapes health.
