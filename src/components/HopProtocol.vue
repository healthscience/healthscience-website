      <div style="word-break: break-word" class="spacing-playground mt-2 mx-6 pa-6 ">
        Use HOP to build N=1 coherence networks peer to peer.  21st century technology opens up a new paradigm for health.  This can happen as data and scientific understanding of nature has advanced and is now combined with machine learning.  However, there is a choice to be made: Do we want to be the primary agent in our health or do we want to outsource our sovereignty to the cloud & corporations?  HOP and the no-code toolkit BentoBoxDS provides a way to choose agency and sovereignty. Through self experimentation and building networks of collective intelligence peer to peer the understanding and application of science to health will advance rigorously.

      <div style="word-break: break-word" class="spacing-playground body-1 mt-2 mx-6 pa-6 ">
        A sovereign peer can learn much in isolation but can learn much more in a network.  The health of a bioregion to a model of the climate requires a new level of computational coherence and HOP (health oracle protocol) has be designed to make that possible. Check out the HOP <v-btn to='/lab' small color="purple">LAB</v-btn> for projects.  Lastly, the monetary incentives of health reward treating disease and exploiting nature. HOP has no monetary incentive built-in, our focus is on empowering the coherence of computations with sovereign data that shapes health.
